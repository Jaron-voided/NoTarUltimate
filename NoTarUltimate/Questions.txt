1) Am I casting to different data types too much?
2) Pack feels like its good, just needs refactored. Am I headed in the correct direction?
3) NotarPackage.FromDirectory "RelativeTo" wants to be a non static method?
4) I went through Header and corrected the bytes and my padding size?
5) Pack and unpack are going to  be called by another function?
6) NotarFileList.AddFile | I'm unsure of  how to obtain this information currently

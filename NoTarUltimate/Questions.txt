NotarHeader:
1) I set it up similar to a couple of the pictures you sent me.
2) I'm unsure if the HeaderFactory should be in this class, or in the NotarFile class if it was with NotarFile 
    instead I wouldn't have to pass in files, I could just access it from my member.
3) Ultimately I could iterate through all my files and figure out the DirectoryCount through PayloadSize. I'm 
    unsure about the PayloadHash currently but I haven't looked into the options.
4) Should the versions and FeatureFlags be set up interactively? As in the program runs and the command line asks
    "What version is this" and stores the response as Version? 

NotarFile:
1) This is what I ultimately want to return from my final method "PackFile" or "CreateNotarFile"
    aside from this I'm unsure if my factories should reside in here, or any logic.

NotarFileList:
1) I made a wrapper for NotarFileInfo like you suggested, since the finished NotarFile will have a list of files.
I'm unsure of what other logic can go in here.

NotarFileInfo:
1) My FileFactory() should be able to extract information from the filestream and construct my NotarFileInfo
2) Would I serialize them as I did with my NotarHeader?

NotarPayloadItem
1) I'm unsure if I even need this class anymore. I still haven't wrapped my head around how I can download a Tar file
    and extract it if the Tar file didn't contain RawData, but I have a few pages pulled up to read further on it.
    
Utils
1) I imagine there are other utilities I will need to code in here.
